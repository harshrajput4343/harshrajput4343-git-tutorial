How to initialize a git in github


first go to project main directory by cd "path to project main directory"

…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# harshrajput4343-git-tutorial" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/harshrajput4343/harshrajput4343-git-tutorial.git
git push -u origin main




…or push an existing repository from the command line
cd path/to/your/project
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/harshrajput4343/harshrajput4343-git-tutorial.git
git remote -v
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main



If copied from somewhere then use it 
# remove old origin and add your new repo URL
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/harshrajput4343/laptop-price-predictor-regression.git

# ensure branch name
git branch -M main

# push your changes and set upstream
git push -u origin main





if this will occur :
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/harshrajput4343/harshrajput4343-Docker-Learning.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: use 'git pull' before pushing again.


then:
# First, fetch and merge remote main branch
git pull origin main --rebase

# Then push your local changes
git push -u origin main

If you want to overwrite remote completely (dangerous, deletes remote history):

git push origin main --force
