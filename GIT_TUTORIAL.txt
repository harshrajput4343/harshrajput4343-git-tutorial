How to initialize a git in github


first go to project main directory by cd "path to project main directory"

…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# harshrajput4343-git-tutorial" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/harshrajput4343/harshrajput4343-git-tutorial.git
git push -u origin main




…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/harshrajput4343/harshrajput4343-git-tutorial.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main




if this will occur :
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/harshrajput4343/harshrajput4343-Docker-Learning.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: use 'git pull' before pushing again.


then:
# First, fetch and merge remote main branch
git pull origin main --rebase

# Then push your local changes
git push -u origin main
